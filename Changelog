    * The UserList is now located on the right, instead of merged with the left TreeView.
      There is a peculiar GTKWarning which i don't know how to get rid of, it doesn't seem to couse any problems but might in some cases
      (It only shows the first time anything is added to the ListStore)
    * Added a way to close channels

    * When joining a channel that channel gets automatically selected,
      and also it says "You have joined #channel"

    * Fixed some user list problems:
    When a normal user joined, in some cases he appeared above a user with a mode.

    PongStuff.py(joinResp)[Line 379], The onUserJoin event(Which adds the user that joined
    to the TreeView) gets called instantaneously instead of using idle_add, this might couse a SEGFAULT!

    * Better debug information printing.
