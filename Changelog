    I know this isn't correct ChangeLog format...

    * Fixed some user list problems:
    When a normal user joined, in some cases he appeared above a user with a mode.

    PongStuff.py(joinResp)[Line 379], The onUserJoin event(Which adds the user that joined
    to the TreeView) gets called instantaneously instead of using idle_add, this might couse a SEGFAULT!

    * Better debug information printing.
